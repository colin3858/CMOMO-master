# coinstrained multi-objective molecule optimization (CMOMO)

Implementation of the method proposed in the paper "Balancing property optimization and constraint
satisfaction for constrained multi-property molecular
optimization" by Xin Xia, Yajie Zhang, Xiangxiang Zeng, Xingyi Zhang, Chunhou Zheng, Yansen Su.<sup>1</sup>

### Dependencies
- [cddd](https://github.com/jrwnter/cddd)
  - Notice: You need download the pre-trained encoder-decoder CDDD model to mapping molecules between SMILES and continuous vectors. It can be load by the bash script:
```
./download_default_model.sh
```
The link is also provided on [cddd](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ccJEclD1dxTNTUswUvIVygqRQSawUCnJ/view?usp=sharing).

### Optimization
```
python CMOMO_task1.py
python CMOMO_task2.py
python CMOMO_task3.py
python CMOMO_task4.py
```
The output results, i.e., optimized molecules, are summarized in TSCMO_task1_endsmiles, and further save in .csv file.



### Writing your own Objective Function
The fitness function can wrap any function that has following properties:
- Takes a RDKit mol object as input and returns a number as score.
- Uses pyTDC platform to gets the properties such as QED, logp, Drd2, JNK3,...
- Uses docking platform such as qvina 2 to get the protein-ligand docking score.
